    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Project is to analyze data about diverse species observed in various national park areas. The data used for this project was obtained from the national park service and is *inspired* by genuine data but is primarily fictitious. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyse, prepare, plot data, and attempt to explain the conclusions of the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project objective can be broken down into the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are particular sorts of species more likely to become endangered?\n",
    "- Are differences in species conservation status relatively significant?\n",
    "- Which animals are most common, and how are they distributed among parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "'Observations.csv' and 'Species info.csv' - [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n"

    "# Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to help the national park services to prevent loss of biodiversity from various national parks. The loss of biodiversity impacts the whole eco system of the park as a whole since all life forms within the park depend on each other either directly or indirectly.\n",
    "\n",
    " The first section defines the project goals; this section will outline the high-level objectives and set the project's aims. The second section is the data; which is already provided in this project, but it still needs to be cleaned and tuned to meet the project goals. The third section includes the analysis, which includes the methodologies and questions that are linked with the project objectives. Finally, the evaluation will aid us in drawing conclusions to explain our findings from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective of the this project will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. As analysts, we want to identify any at-risk and endangered species to ensure their survival, in order to maintain a high level of biodiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives as an analyst will be understanding characteristics about the species, their conservations status, and their relationship to the rest of the national park's ecosystem. The project goals can be framed into the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Identify types of species which are more likely to be endangered if any?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal species is the most common and what is their distribution amongst different national parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first `csv` file has information about each species and the other has observations of species with respective park locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform data analysis, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be employed to understand the data. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. counts\n",
    "1. relationship between species\n",
    "1. conservation status of species\n",
    "1. observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in this section we will revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis can explain the questions we first set to answer. This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were left un-answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different techniques.\n"
